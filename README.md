# Grants-Demographics-Analysis


# Question: 
How likely is it that minority groups get grad-level grants for school?



## Findings: 
Most of the minorities have a very small percentage of stem grants awarded to them. The ‘other’ category are open to all other stem grant opportunities that aren’t specific to certain minorities. I was tempted to call this category ‘white’, but that is technically inaccurate without knowing exactly the demographic data of who was awarded these awards. This group technically could include minorities as well, recipients’ receiving the grants weren’t specific to their minority status. So this could include minority students. However, it is safe to say that with the amount of non-minority students’ dominance in these fields, it is likely that they (white) have a much higher likelihood of receiving the awards.
